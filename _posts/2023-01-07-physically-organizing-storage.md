title: organizing my physical stuff
date: '2023-01-07'

i generally take off the last and first week of the year as a winter vacation. while i would love to say that i typically spend all of that time relaxing with friends and family, and i do some of that, i typically put together a list of things i want to get done during that time. one item that is frequently on that list is cleaning my office or garage. while i typically keep these places relatively clean, i will revisit my organization in those areas typically during this time off. this year is no exception, but i've decided to switch things up to begin to age out some of the items that i use very infrequently. i thought it would be helpful to write this down here.

## what is the as-is situation?

currently i think of all of my tools and equipment and random things as 'piles of stuff'. i go through the piles of stuff and pull out what i need and then i typically put it back, but not always. over time, the stuff not put away ends up in piles in my office or somewhere else. these piles at some point need to be put away or forced out of the way for some more pressing need. this means those piles get merged into slightly larger piles by way of being put into some boxes or containers which get put into the garage. over years this leads to this kind of pile of piles. =)

the main issue is the same as anyone, sometimes i need something and i can't find it. sometimes that means i have to buy another of the same thing, or sometimes i find an extra one or whatever. this cycle repeats and the piles grow. every so often, i go through and try and clean up a bit, put some stuff into buckets/bins to organize, etc. but i haven't really strictly adhered to any kind of planned method or anything.

## thinking about what to do?

well, there are a million ways to address this problem. 'problem' is probably a little much for a situation which really just boils down to 'have too much stuff' or 'when item not found, buy replacement' which are very nice problems to have. =P that reality aside, it is an annoying problem that grows over time and so i'd like to address it. one way i address this with my paperwork is by just archiving paperwork from time to time. typically i put everything into a box based on the year and maybe quarter or month if needed, then i store that. most things are digital so the times i need to go back are very rare, usually only for tax season if i don't straighten everything out very quickly.

so since i need to address the issue of easily getting the stuff i need, this 'archive everything' method doesn't work as well. one thing i have had in my mind for several years was an article i read about how libraries work. they basically keep a cache of the recent books closer at hand before putting them back on the shelf so it's quick.

since i'm in the it world, this just seems like lifo to me or resembles using a push/pop stack in real life. i had some type of sorting before where i had buckets of specific things. a bucket for 'cutting things' or a bucket for 'batteries' or something similar, but i didn't really take an life cycle approach to this, it was more of a pragmatic way to clean up. i would clean up and toss everything that i didn't want/need and would put away the things to keep in some kind of bin, then i would just stack them up. the end. very simple, but this didn't have any way to systematically age anything out. i would just 'age stuff out' when i moved or we got a car that required reorganizing the garage due to size or, in one rare case, a flood hit us and trashed my shop.

i'd like to avoid doing this in the future, so i'm going to implement some kind of aging system built into the organization

## the solution

i broke my items to store into several categories. the categories had to be small enough that they would, at most, fit into a 66 qt storage bin, and preferably fit into a 34 qt storage bin. these bins are flat and fit my existing storage shelf very well.





upon first getting engaged, i did some inventory. there are currently no it folks at the school. one of the things i noticed is we had quite a lot of chromebooks, quite a lot of older macs, and some pcs. the pcs seemed to be purchased by the previous it person who preferred pcs over chromebooks or macs. the teachers all loved macs. this spans a couple of years and some purchases took place during the pandemic, so it's not exactly normal times and i won't digress much on that.

as it stood today, we had about 35 chromebooks, about 35 pcs that looked *exactly* like the chromebooks, and then some pcs and old macs. we also had about 30 *old* chromebooks that were no longer getting updates that were various flavors. it also happened to be that this summar [chromeOS](https://chromeenterprise.google/os/) was finally released. google bought another company that helped make this happen and you can read more about that [here](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/google-acquired-neverware-makers-of-cloudready-chromeos-variant/)

so, the teachers hated the pcs, i don't think they loved the chromebooks, but at the start of the school year there was not budget to buy all new macs or anything. so as an interim solution, and to make things more managable with google (as it was already in house) we put chromeos on the chromebook pc wannabes. these were running windows10 at the time.

so, to explain this section title, when chromeOS was installed, some of the touchpads didn't work. this resulted in many tickets like "my mousepad doesn't work" or "student says computer is broken" etc.

## didn't you test

yes. yes i did. unfortunately i didn't test every computer and these are touch screen so since i was working on sometimes 5-10 at a time, i was normally using the touch screen. plus when i got involved it was a bit of a time crunch to just get things somewhat ready for the new year so it was what it was. i thought a couple of them may have this issue, but it seemed like the minority.

the computers in question were both Lenovo 300e devices. One was a chromebook, and the other was a windows device. so this seemed like such an easy way to standardize the fleet on a chrome experience. at least for these devices. i thought i was set. even if the last person bought devices that didn't seem to be much loved, at least we could have something consistent and things would be happy'er than having chromeos and windows. or so i thought.

## trouble in paradise

there were actually several issues when i started this process. first, it seemed that chromeos (at least the version at the time) would not support the 64gb emmc driver installed already. i already knew from having one of these devices opened there was another hard driver slot, so i ordered some nvme drivers to use instead. these were about 10 bucks each and that seemed like a pretty easy trade off. i got things in, and loaded up chromeos with no issues. once installed, i discovered the second issue, the touchpad not always working. i did notice the touchpad issue, but when i discussed with administration during the summer it sounded like it was no big deal as these are all touch screen tablet machines anyway. i also didn't feel like i saw it on more than a couple of devices, and we were in a rush so we just moved on. finally, while i was waiting for the hard drives to come in, i did go ahead and upgrade and patch these to win11 and get everything setup on them. this was great, but the third issue i ran into was how to manage logins on these devices. i'll skip that for now as we went with chromeos, but i was a little sad to basically turn off everything i setup for dealing with windows. ðŸ˜€

## these touchpads don't work?!

i was tied up and unable to help deal with the ongoing chaos of school starting due to my actual day job when school started. by the time i was able to swing by the school again to discuss, first week of school was over. this is when i found out the biggest issue seemed to be that the touchpads didn't work. so even though this was discussed, it seemed like it was as if those discussions had never happened and lots of folks were sad that the touchpads didn't work. oops. =) sorry folks, decisions were made! 

so since this seemed to be such a major issue, i started trying to figure out why. as with most computer things, it's going to be hardware or software. the touchpads worked on all of these devices in windows, so this seems to be a software thing. i mean they worked on *all* the windows devices, not just some. since all of the 'working' devices were in use, i only had some that didn't work. in hindsight i wish i would have just gotten back one that worked. this is what eventually happened and when i compared the two devices point by point, i found that the newer bios version for the lenovo device didn't work. The one that wasn't working that I had was running version [FRCN21WW](https://download.lenovo.com/consumer/mobiles/FRCN21WW.txt) which was current and released in July 2021 and the working one was running [FRCN18WW](https://download.lenovo.com/consumer/mobiles/frcn18ww.txt) which was released in Feb 2021. After a downlevel and reboot, touchpad was working. as i write this, i have yet to update the other 10ish that i know of that don't work, but fingers crossed.

i also ran into an issue where the bios updater didn't seem to work in windows 11. it would reboot, but do nothing. i had to shift+restart to the recovery menu, then i could run command line and run bios from there and it all worked like a champ. it seemed to wipeout the chromeos bootloader, but i just reloaded chrome and all was well.

just to illustrate how similar these devices look...

chromebook:

basically identical except for that chrome logo.

## so... happily ever after?

well, not quite. for this issue, yes. but i also have some *other* lenovo devices with other issues with chromeos, including some others with touchpad issues. hopefully an old bios update will work for those as well. i think my biggest current issue is the lpd printing on these chromeos devices doesn't seem to work right with our larger ricoh network printers. that's a post for another day, though. ðŸ˜€
