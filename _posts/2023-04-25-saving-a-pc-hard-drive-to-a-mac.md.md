title: saving a pc hard drive to a mac

if you are anything like me you are tech support for many folks in your family. sometimes their computers die or something happens where you just need to get the data off of their computer. for me the most annoying part of this is the disk is frequently slow. there are lots of ways to solve this issue, but i usually do this by simply creating an image of the drive so that i can put the device back together and work with the data on my mac.

## tldr;

1. take the drive out of whatever it's in
2. plug it into your computer somehow
3. open up disk utility
4. right click on the drive and create image from drive

## can i get a screenshot?

i don't do this much, but i feel like i always have to go back and lookup what to do so that's why i'm writing this. it is a very simple process, but there are some options during this process, but i usually do things this way in the end.

### 1. take the drive out of whatever it's in

i don't have a consistent screenshot for this. for me this is usually pc cases from typical brands like hp and dell. if you are doing this type of support for your family, you probably already know how to do this. if not, search youtube for something like 'diy remove hard drive from pc' and there are lots of videos. if you can add the brand and model, sometimes you can find something that specific. generally you are just opening the case using a screw or lever depending on how it is. finding the hard drive and unplugging it, then removing it from it's mounting setup which could involve screws or clips or something like that. *most* cases today make this process relatively painless.

### 2. plug it into your computer somehow

i have had a ton of things to plug drives into over the years. most recently (which prompted me to write this article) i needed to plug in a larger drive, so i bought [this](https://a.co/d/63tuRH3). not an affiliate link, just a link. i like this one as it's powered and can mount to some older pin drives, not just sata. if you have some other format you'll need that too. hopefully if you are getting recruited to do this by your family, you already know how to hook up a drive to your own computer.

### 3. open up disk utility

I just use spotlight search (`cmd+space`) and type in disk utility and start it up. you can also open finder and hit `shift+cmd+u` to open up utilities and select it in that folder.

### 4. right click on the drive and create image from drive


## what next?

after this, it's easy to just double click on the dmg file and then open the mounted drive that shows up on your desktop. for me, i am usually either giving this to a family member that has switched to a mac to use, or i am just sitting with them and copying the files they need off. yes, i could do this as soon as i mount the drive, but a lot of times i need to take a computer to check it and this step only happens if there is something bad happening with the computer. in my most recent situation, the windows folder seemed to be corrupt, and it was a 10 year old machine. so really we just wanted to pull the data off as this machine was only used to access some old docs and there was already a newer machine to use. but this way i have the whole drive and i can just bring my laptop and a small usb drive to move data to the new machine and the old machine can just be disposed of or stored in a closet somewhere for later, just-in-case reasons.

## mac vs pc

i am definitely pro pc, but for family i always recommend macs and apple products. there are plenty of walled-garden problems to have with the apple ecosystem, but for me personally it just makes my life easier. i really never have issues with any family that have apple devices, but pcs always eventually have some crazy thing happen. this is definitely user related as i do have some family with pcs that have minimal issues, but i can't fix the users and over the course of years it is just easier to have people have macs as they generally don't break and don't have the same random issues. i switched all of my home devices over to macs a few years back just because it made it easier to support those folks even though i still use windows regularly for work and write a lot of powershell code. i just use powershell core on the mac. ðŸ˜€

i volunteer for all of the it issues at my children's school as well and generally recommend macs there as well for the same reason, although generally prefer to go with chromebooks for students. i think if i could get everyone to use chromebooks that would make my life *even easier* than the macs, but have not had much luck getting folks to stick to linux, chromeos, or chromebooks over the years vs apple products.
